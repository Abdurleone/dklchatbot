AI-Driven Chatbot Backend
Overview
This is the backend for an AI-driven chatbot designed to integrate with a website, providing real-time responses to user queries by leveraging an LLM (e.g., xAI's Grok API) and a MongoDB database. The chatbot interprets user intents, queries the database for relevant data (e.g., lab services, FAQs), and generates natural responses. Built with Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Mongoose, it’s optimized for scalability and easy deployment.
Features

Real-Time Chat: Handles user messages via WebSockets for instant responses.
AI Integration: Uses an LLM (placeholder for xAI Grok API) to classify user intents.
MongoDB Queries: Fetches data from a services collection (extensible to other collections like FAQs).
Security: Includes basic rate limiting and input sanitization.
Scalability: Ready for containerization (Docker) and cloud deployment (e.g., AWS EC2 with ALB).

Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
xAI API Key (or alternative LLM API key, see https://x.ai/api)
npm (Node Package Manager)

Installation

Clone the Repository (or copy the project files):
git clone https://github.com/Abdurleone/dklchatbot.git
cd dklchatbot-backend


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the project root:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster0.mongodb.net/labdb?retryWrites=true&w=majority
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here
PORT=3000


Replace MONGODB_URI with your MongoDB connection string.
Obtain XAI_API_KEY from https://x.ai/api (or use another LLM API key).


MongoDB Setup:

Ensure a MongoDB database is running (local or Atlas).
Create a services collection with sample data, e.g.:{
  "name": "Blood Test",
  "description": "Complete blood count analysis",
  "price": 1500,
  "category": "Hematology"
}




Run the Server:
node server.js

The server will start on http://localhost:3000 (or your specified PORT).


Usage

Health Check: Test the server with GET /health (returns { status: 'OK' }).
Chat Functionality: Connect a Socket.io client (e.g., a frontend chat widget) to ws://<your-server-url>:3000.
Send messages via the message event.
Receive responses via the response event.


Example Interaction:
User sends: "Tell me about blood tests."
Server queries MongoDB services collection and responds with matching service details.

Deployment

Docker: Create a Dockerfile for containerization:FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]


Cloud: Deploy on AWS EC2 with Application Load Balancer (ALB) or similar for scaling.
Monitoring: Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for metrics (to be added).

Extending the Chatbot

Add Collections: Extend Mongoose schemas for FAQs, patient data, etc.
More Intents: Update server.js to handle additional query types (e.g., appointments).
Integrations: Add Twilio for SMS, Zoho Desk for ticketing, or Power BI for analytics.
Frontend: Pair with a chat widget (e.g., React component) for website integration.

Troubleshooting

MongoDB Errors: Verify MONGODB_URI and ensure the database is accessible.
API Errors: Check XAI_API_KEY and API endpoint (https://x.ai/api).
Socket Issues: Ensure the client connects to
